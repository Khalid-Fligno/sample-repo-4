1)if in workout count === true 
    then 
    1)DifficultyLevel,workIntervalMap is based to each exercise level.
    2)DifficultyLevel ,workIntervalMap,restInterval of workout level is not in used then.
    3)Exercise not have timer then.

2)if in workout count === false 
    then  
    1)DifficultyLevel,workIntervalMap is based to workout level.


3)filter contains 'strength => 
    then
    1)workIntervalMap ->[60,60,60] ,restIntervalMap=>[0,0,0].

4)filter contains 'circuit,interval' => 
    then
    1)workIntervalMap === difficultyLevel


5)if in workout doc contain rest === false or true and workoutProcessType === 'circular' 
        then 
        1)there is no rest in that workout process. 
        2)if you include rest video last of that exercises list then u will see the Rest at last set of that workout.

6)if in workout doc contain workoutProcessType === 'oneByOne'  
        then
        1)There is no rest in that workout.
        2)first complete all set of each workout after that goes to next and repeat the same one by one process 
            till the end of exercise.
        3)sets is depend on workoutReps which is in number format    

7)If in workout doc contain workoutProcessType === 'circular'
        then
        1)Then is rest after the 1 set of each exercise.
        2)In this process there is 1 set of all workout at time then goes to 2nd and perform same process 
            circularaly till the workoutReps.
        3)sets is depend on workoutReps.

8)If in workout doc contain workoutProcessType === 'onlyOne'    
        then
        1)there is only one exercise in each workout.
        2)There is rest after each set of exercise.
        3)sets is depend on workoutReps.

9)workoutReps is the sets of each exercise.

10)workIntervalMap is the Array which defined time of exercise as per the difficultyLevel        

11)restIntervalMap is the Array which defined time of rest as per the difficultyLevel.

12)difficultyLevel is Array which defined intensity of user to do exercise.
    eg:[1,2,3]
